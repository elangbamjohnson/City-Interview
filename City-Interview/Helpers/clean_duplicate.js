questions[38].answer = `Instruments is Apple's profiling app that comes with Xcode. You open it with Product > Profile (Cmd + I). It records what your app is doing while it runs, such as CPU, memory, and screen drawing. Each tool inside it answers one question. Use it on a real device, with a Release build.

Say it like this:
"I pick the tool based on the symptom, because each one answers a different question.

Time Profiler answers 'where is my CPU time going?' It takes samples of the call stack many times a second, so I see which functions take the most time. I use it when the app feels slow or the UI freezes. I look at the main thread and use 'Invert Call Tree' and 'Hide System Libraries' to find my own heavy function quickly.

Allocations answers 'how much memory is my app using, and what is using it?' It tracks every object created. I use it when memory keeps growing. I use the Generations feature: I take a snapshot, do an action like opening and closing a screen a few times, take another snapshot, and look at what stayed in memory. That tells me what is not being freed.

Leaks answers 'which objects can never be freed?' It finds memory that nothing points to anymore, but was never released. It is good for finding the classic leaks. But it misses retain cycles where objects still point to each other, so I also use the Memory Graph debugger in Xcode for those.

Hangs answers 'when did the UI stop responding?' It marks the moments when the main thread was blocked for too long, usually more than 250 milliseconds. I use it to find the exact moment of a freeze, then look at what the main thread was doing at that time.

Animation Hitches answers 'why does my scrolling or animation stutter?' A hitch is a frame that appears late. The tool shows which frames were late and whether the cause was my app's work (commit) or the system rendering. I use it for janky scrolling and slow transitions."

Which Tool for Which Symptom:
• App feels slow, CPU high: Time Profiler — Inspect heaviest functions on the main thread (Invert Call Tree & Hide System Libraries).
• Memory keeps growing: Allocations — Use Generations feature to compare snapshots and see what objects stay alive.
• Objects never freed: Leaks — Identify leaked objects and their exact allocation stack traces.
• UI freezes for a moment: Hangs — Detect exact moments where the main runloop was blocked (> 250ms).
• Scroll or animation stutters: Animation Hitches — Pinpoint late frames and isolate Commit phase vs Render phase delays.

Good to Mention (Staff-Level Interview Points):
• Always profile a Release build on a real device: Debug builds disable compiler optimizations and inject debug assertions; the Simulator uses your Mac's CPU and memory architecture.
• Other specialized tools: App Launch for startup pre-main dyld and post-main setup, Network for slow endpoints, Energy Log for battery/GPS drain, and SwiftUI instrument for redundant view body evaluations.
• Combined Template: Hangs and Animation Hitches are bundled together in the "Hangs and Hitches" template in Xcode Instruments.
• Subtle Memory Growth: A small, steady growth in Allocations across repeated user flows signifies a logical leak, even if the Leaks instrument reports 0 leaks.
• Field Observability: Complement Instruments with Xcode Organizer and MetricKit to observe real-world hangs and hitches across customer devices.

One-liner: Time Profiler finds slow code, Allocations and Leaks find memory problems, Hangs finds UI freezes, and Animation Hitches finds stutter.

Memory trick: C-M-L-F-S → "CPU = Time Profiler, Memory = Allocations, Leaks = never freed, Freeze = Hangs, Stutter = Hitches."`;
